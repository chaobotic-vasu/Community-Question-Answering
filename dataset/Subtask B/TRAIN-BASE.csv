Qtel ADSL speed question,From today 4 pm local time; internet been dragging here; is it just me or whole Qatar? as always qtel customer service sucks sh*; 20 mins no ones picked yet; i hung up.. Anyones been feelin the same.. seems 2mb line isnt that fast eh? lol...remember the last time it happened some under sea cables broke up..hope its not all again.. abdallah,Qtel offers 512k; 1MB; and 2MB ADSL for 200;300; or 400QR per month. I am moving to a place where I will have to decide which subscription. Would like some advice from experienced people. Is the extra speed worth it? Is the speed difference noticeable? I ask the question because the place where I am living now provides an Internet connection via a cable and the speed of the connection varies a lot.,Relevant
